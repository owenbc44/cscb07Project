	The team met at 5pm on Monday, November 11th to discuss phase 1 of the assignment. A large part of this meeting was spent discussing whose code we should base the project off. In the end, the decision to use Ali’s was unanimous. We came to this decision by going over each part of the assignment one by one (in the order they appear in the handout) and every one of us explained how their code for that part worked (or doesn’t). Although some had interesting ideas and parts that were arguably done better, it was clear Ali’s assignment was the best overall and right choice as he was one of the few group members to reach the end of the assignment. Ali was also able to thoroughly test his code, and having methods such as promoteEmployee or checkOut that we can be sure are working as intended will be important and handy going forward. There were parts that Ali not only completed, but also had a better implementation of, for example, for the database helper classes, while some of us had a few exceptions and others none at all, Ali had written more and better exceptions than anyone else. Additionally, we believe his code also had the best design as he was the closest to properly implementing SOLID design guidelines, some of having not even considered them. 

	Having gotten to the end of the assignment, he also has a better understanding of what exactly each method does and how the different classes interact with each other. With his knowledge, reusing methods and making new ones should be easier and help us better organize the project. For example, the constructors that used authenticated were confusing to most of us but Ali understands how to implement and how to use them.
